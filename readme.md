## Analysis:
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud or VPC is amazon virtual network, it acts like a normal tradiontal network with subnets. routing tables and gateways but aws infrastucture. Terraform is infrastruture code software that uses HCL or JSON laungages; and supported by most Cloud providers. All networks in generally need some type of infrastucture, so that it can work and subnet make easier to divide networks.
## Solution:
The solution starts by going into main.tf(look at first image) making the provider to connect aws; then making vpc, internet gateway and default routes like when putting in ipv4. Once the set-up is done, we go to vpc.tf(to make it easier found the subnets) and then create 9 subnets equal divided as public, private and data. We can do this as terraform can connect to aws and then create vpc without going into aws sever itself.

## Analysis:
Helm Charts are just Kubernates packages and opernation managemers; Kubernates being contianer-orchestration system used for automaticing apps deploymemt, scaling and management. The chart itself being collection of files related set of Kubernates resources; which can easily be deployed, even if its highly complex.
